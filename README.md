## Essential Workflows
![Essential sosw Workflow Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sosw/sosw/docme/docs/_static/images/simple-sosw.png)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
- [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) (AWS SDK for Python)

## Installation
See the [Installation Guidelines](https://docs.sosw.app/en/master/installation.html) in the Documentation.

## Development
### Getting Started

Assuming you have Python 3.6 and `pipenv` installed. Create a new virtual environment: 

```bash
$ pipenv shell
```

Now install the required dependencies for development:

```bash
$ pipenv sync --dev
```

### Running Tests

Running unit tests:
```bash
$ pytest ./sosw/test/suite_unit.py
```

### Contribution Guidelines

The latest [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.sosw.app/en/master/contribution/index.html) with examples are in the documentation.

#### Release cycle
- We follow both [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) pattern
  and [PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) recommendations where comply
- Master branch commits (merges) are automatically packaged and published to PyPI.
- Branches for planned staging versions follow the pattern: `X_Y_Z` (Major.Minor.Micro)
- Make your pull requests to the closest staging branch (with smallest after release number of either current or next Minor)
- Make sure your branch is up to date with the branch you are making a PR to

Example:
  - Latest released version in PyPI `0.7.31`
  - Closest staging Minor branch in sosw/sosw `0_7_33`
  - Latest Minor staging branch in sosw/sosw `0_7_35`
  - Closest Next Minor branch in sosw/sosw `0_9_1`

Your PR should be to either `0_7_33` or `0_9_1` depending on the importance of changes. 

#### Code formatting
Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but:
- both classes and functions are padded with 2 empty lines
- dictionaries are value-alligned

#### Initialization
1. Fork the repository: https://github.com/sosw/sosw
2. Register Account in AWS: [SignUp](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
3. Run `pipenv sync â€“dev` to setup your virtual environment and download the required dependencies
4. Create DynamoDB Tables: 
    - You can find the CloudFormation template for the databases [in the example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sosw/sosw/docme/docs/yaml/sosw-shared-dynamodb.yaml).
    - If you are not familiar with CloudFormation, we highly recommend at least learning the basics from [the tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html).
5. Create Sandbox Lambda with Scheduler
6. Play with it.
7. Read the Documentation Convention.

#### More
See more guidelines for contribution [in the docs](https://docs.sosw.app/en/master/contribution/index.html).

### Building the docs
Sphinx is used for building documentation.
You can build HTML documentation locally then use the built in Python web server to view the html version directly from `localhost` in your preferred browser.

```bash
$ sphinx-build -ab html ./docs ./sosw-rtd; (cd sosw-rtd && python -m http.server)
```
